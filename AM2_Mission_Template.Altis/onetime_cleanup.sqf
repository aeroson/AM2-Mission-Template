	NAME: onetime_cleanup.sqf
	VERSION: 2.1.3
	CONTRIBUTE: https://github.com/aeroson/a3-misc

	DESCRIPTION:
	one call deletes stuff within radius from player that is not really needed:
	dead bodies, dropped items, smokes, chemlights, explosives
	beware: if weapons on ground are intentional e.g. fancy weapons stack, it will delete them too
	beware: if dead bodies are intentional it will delete them to
	
	USAGE:
	put this into init of anything:
	this addAction ["Cleanup around you", { [300,["dropped","corpses","wrecks","misc"]] execVM "onetime_cleanup.sqf"; } ];
	where 300 is radius of cleanup, default is 1000
	[1000,["dropped","corpses","wrecks","misc"]] execVM "onetime_cleanup.sqf";
